WP Term Manager helps users clean up or hide terms for easier administration.

== Description ==

After you've been using your website for a little while you probably have some categories, tags, or custom terms you once used, no longer use, but don't want to wade through. WP Term Manager allows you to hide these terms.

The settings can be found under Tools > WP Term Manager. Select which terms you want hidden and click "Save Changes". That's it!

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option. WordPress will handle the file transfer and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WP Term Manager, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New”.

In the search field type “WP Term Manager”, then click “Search Plugins”. Once you’ve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the release, rating, and description. Most importantly you can install it by clicking “Install Now” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the WP Term Manager plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).
